For this reason we call the perceiver role in this frame Perceiver_agentive.    'She gazed upon him fondly.'  Comparing the Perception_active frame to the Perception_experience frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_active contains the verb phrase look at, Perception_experience contains see.   For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical item in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell.  This first sentence exemplifies the Perception_active use of the verb smell:'Smell this to see if it's fresh.CNI' This second sentence exemplifies its Perception_experience sense: 'I smell something rotten.'

The Size_change of an Item may be explicitly indicated or characterized in terms of Initial_size and/or Result_size.  In the default case, expansion is along all dimensions, but sometimes the Dimension of expansion is incorporated or made explicit.  'The pile of leaves had shrunk by about half after the first haul.'  'The jeans stretched a little.'~$~Weapon: A Weapon is an artifact created specifically to cause harm or damage.  In some cases, a Use, Material of construction, Part or Type may be more narrowly specified. 'Did you, or did you not, fire this gun with intent to harm my client?' 'Cyra tried to swing her sword to parry, but it was to heavy.' 'I investigated a specialist precious metal firearms manufacturer.'

'Susanna Fulton's work is new to me.'  'Two of these frames were new to me as a beginning professor.'  'This was as new to him as the rest of the outcity.'  'JSON is fairly new to me as a data format.'  'Moreover, this way of describing and categorizing architecture is familiar to most people.'  'Coronaviruses are not unfamiliar to the epidemiological world.'  'Abbey Stadium will bring us into contact with one familiar face at least.'~$~Age: An Entity has existed for a length of time, the Age. The Age can be characterized as a value of the age Attribute, or a Degree modifier may express the deviation of the Age from the norm. The Expressor exhibits qualities of the age of the Entity.  'This building is twenty thousand years old.'  'My grandpa is really old'  'Junior is only five weeks old.'  'A cunning oldish voice called out from the crowd.'  'His age was 23 at the time.'  ' People of  age 55 or older should consult their physician.

Being physical objects, these Roadways may have Names and Characteristics; they are also made of a Material.  They also cover ground, so they may have a Path or a Relative_location that the travel occurs in.  ' We crossed the brick road.' ' I prefer to travel on highway I-80.'

Words in this frame designate relatively stable bounded ares of the world which have permanent Relative_locations with respect to other locales, and thus are useful as permanent landmarks.  It is inherited by Locale_by_use, which has to do with places that are named according to their intended use, or some habitual use, such as factory.n, dance floor.n, village.n, field.n.  It is also inherited by Locale_by_event, which covers places that are names according to some event which took place there, such as concerts, battles, and meteor impacts.~$~Placing: Generally without overall (translational) motion,  an Agent places a Theme at a location, the Goal, which is profiled.  In this frame, the Theme is under the control of the Agent/Cause at the time of its arrival at the Goal.  'David placed his briefcase on the floor.'  This frame differs from Filling in that it focuses on the Theme rather than the effect on the Goal entity.  It differs from Removing in focusing on the Goal rather than the Source of motion for the Theme.",0
12,"new construction is everywhere , the streets buzz , traffic is increasingly congested , and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else .",intent.a,26,intent.a: resolved or determined to do.,Purpose,"Purpose: An Agent wants to achieve a Goal,  or an object, a Means , has been created or is used to allow the creator or a  user to achieve a  Goal. The Goal is an state of the world that does not currently obtain but which the Agent wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talk about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .' 'The object of the tutorial is to help a student concentrate on his writing skills ' ' The prime goal of the programme was to help develop processes of scientific thinking in children .' 'My goal in this book is to introduce the reader to Web programming applications.' 'The president's economic goal for the country was to overcome the recession.'",0
13,"new construction is everywhere , the streets buzz , traffic is increasingly congested , and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else .",increasingly.adv,11,increasingly.adv: to an increasing extent or frequency.,Change_position_on_a_scale,"Change_position_on_a_scale: This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP ""turbot catches"" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to ""the people"", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP ""the population of Smallville"" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer ""of Smallville"" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute ""1999 price"" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as ""price"" on the 2nd layer.",0

We consider sequenced calendric units (e.g. Tuesday, 1987, January) as periods for the purposes of this frame.  Some lexical items allow certain types of frame elements while disallowing others (e.g. *During Tuesday...).  Several words of this frame (e.g. now.adv) have deictic incorporation of the Landmark_period.  'He tried to take care of that on his last visit .' 'I especially like brunch on Sunday.'

'The ride was speedy and often bumpy.'  'Under high-pressure situations, police officers are very fast at reacting to danger.'~$~Wearing: The words in this frame refer to what Clothing the Wearer (or a specific Body_part of the Wearer) has on.

It can be presented either symmetrically with Participants or asymmetrically, giving Participant_1 greater prominence over Participant_2. If the Event is engaged in intentionally, then there is typically a shared Purpose between the Participants. It is, however, possible that an expressed Purpose only applies to Participant_1.

Motion_noise verbs take largely the same Source, Path and Goal expressions as other types of Motion verbs.  'The reception doors banged open.' 'Guillemots and razor bills whirred rapidly out to sea.' 'The limousine purred forwards into the traffic.' 'Loose guns rumbled all over the ship's deck .' 'The train clanged along for over a thousand miles.'~$~Sounds: This frame is  concerned with the percepts that vibrations which travel through the air or another medium produce in hearing organs. Sounds are a subtype of sensation. In talking about sounds, speakers often provide information about how the sound was produced. A Noisy_event may be mentioned which gives rise to the sound. Alternatively, the sound may be attributed to a Sound_source, which is construed as a point source emitting the sound. A further possible specification of what gives rise to the sound is for speakers to talk about two physical entities coming into contact by motion, resulting in either friction or impact.  ",0

Frame elements include Whole for the whole of which the target is a part,  Relative_time (RelT) for locating the time with respect to an identifiable reference point, and Name for the name of the day (month, etc.) of  a specially named unit.  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions.  There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Iteration, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).",0
